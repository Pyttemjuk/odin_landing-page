I based my project on The Odin Projects Landing Page Project, but I inserted some visual stuff and changed most of the text in order to make it more like me. Colors and font sizing is unchanged. It has been a good way to practice building layouts, but i still feel I lack knowlege on how to organize my CSS code. This will be the next thing to learn.
